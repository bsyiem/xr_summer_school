# Call for Participation 

We are thrilled to invite applications for the XR Research Methods Summer School, a five-day intensive program on 06-10 January 2025 at the University of Sydney. This program is designed for graduate students, researchers, and professionals eager to learn cutting-edge research methods in the rapidly evolving field of extended reality (XR), encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed realities.


The program will cover:
- Developing theory in XR research 
- Designing experiments
- Measures and instruments for XR user experience evaluation
- Bayesian data analysis methods
- ?
- ?

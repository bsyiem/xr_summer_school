# Call for Participation 

It is an incredibly exciting time for XR research! With immersive technologies rapidly advancing, we are at the brink of wider commercial adoption of MR and VR headsets. Research in this area can shape the future of how we work, learn, play, and socialise.

We are thrilled to invite applications for the XR Research Methods Summer School, a five-day intensive program on 06-10 January 2025 at the University of Sydney. This program is designed for graduate students, researchers, and professionals eager to learn cutting-edge research methods in the rapidly evolving field of extended reality (XR), encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed realities.


The program will cover:
- Developing theory in XR research 
- Designing experiments
- Measures and instruments for XR user experience evaluation
- Quantitative data analysis with Bayesian methods
- Qualitative data analysis with Thematic analysis
- Presentation skills

During the Summer School, students will work in groups in developing a new XR-related project, including identifying a problem, formulating research questions, developing a theory, simulating and analysing data, crafting a narrative, and presenting the findings.

## Who Should Apply? 

This summer school is ideal for:

- PhD students pursuing degrees in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Computer Science, or related fields..
- Master’s or Honour’s students interested in pursuing a PhD related to XR.
- Early-career researchers and academics looking to expand their methodological toolkit for XR research.

Application deadline: 01/12/2024 <br/>
Notification: 07/12/2024
